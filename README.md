# Write To CSV

The Write to CSV package is very simple, exposing exactly two functions: `writeHeader` and `append`. 

## writeHeader
`writeHeader` accepts two arguments. 
1. The absolute path to the file (typically the path can be generated by importing `path` and using `__dirname`; for example, `path.join(__dirname, output/nameOfFile.csv)`)
2. Array containing the headers of the CSV.

## append
`append` accepts two arguments. 
1. The absolute path to the file (typically the path can be generated by importing `path` and using `__dirname`; for example, `path.join(__dirname, output/nameOfFile.csv)`) 
2. Array containing the row to be appended to the CSV.
